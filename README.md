## How It Works

- Each skill bar has a `data-percent` attribute.\
- JavaScript reads that value and updates a `--percent` CSS variable.\
- CSS animation smoothly fills the bar to the specified percentage.\
- Each skill component includes:
  - Icon\
  - Skill name\
  - Description\
  - Animated progress indicator
